## Heterostructured materials: superior properties from hetero-zone interaction [review]
[zotero://select/library/items/6T2K3QKI](zotero://select/library/items/6T2K3QKI)
### Heterostructureed materials
#### materials whose inter-zone interactions/couplings produce significant synergistic effect.
#### deformation: back stresses in the soft zone and forward stresses in the hard zones, together produce hetero-deformation induced (HDI) strengthening that increases YS and enhances strain hardening. 
### [[Ultrafine grained steels]]
