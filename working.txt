Footnotes are rendered using bigfoot.js, so that they appear as easy-to-click buttons [^firstfootnote]; when the reader clicks on these, a popover appears. This means the reader can read the note in-place, without jumping around the page [^secondfootnote].
When printed, the buttons are replaced by the more traditional numbers in-situ cross referencing the full text of the notes at the end of the document. This means the notes can still be read without interactivity.

[^firstfootnote]: Rather than as a number.

[^secondfootnote]: and, hopefully, be less distracted.

The solutions of 

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ 

are
\\( 
x=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.  
\\)
and
\\[
x=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.  
\\]


\\[
\sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{1}{x} = 1
\\]
