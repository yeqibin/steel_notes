[[2020052008-dynamic transformation-simulation of strip and plate rolling]]— 



A high amount of 'free' nitrogen in the steel stabilizes the interstitial clusters, and leads to (i) larger loop sizes (ii) lower loop density (iii) slightly reduced radiation induced hardening.

'free' nitrogen also affects Ni diffusion and Ni/Si-rich precipitation.
