When the strained sample at the temperatures above Ae$_3$ were quenched after different holding times, the volume fraction of DT ferrite decreased with holding time. 
- experiments
    - straining
    - holding for varied periods: 1s, 5s, 15s
    - quenching
    - microstructural observation: ferrite/martensite volume fraction
    - dilatometric measurement

Conclusion: the DT ferrite was metastable that was retransformed back into austenite (reverse transformation) during holding.
- forward and reverse transformations occur simultaneously in the intercritical region.

Monte Carlo methods \ref{tong2004}. 
> most of the DT ferrite retransformed back into the more thermodynamically stable austenite in order to minimize the total free energy of the system.

Effect of Nb  \ref{Basabe,Jonas2010}
- addition of Nb significantly delays both the forward and backward transformation.
    - precipitation of Nb(CN)
    - solute drag

The present authors simulated 7 passes of strip rolling on C-Mn and Nb-containing steels with varied interpass intervals of 0.5 and 5s. For hot rolling of heavy plates, the interpass intervals should be more than 10 s.
- mean flow stress (MFS)
- the volume of the DT ferrite in Nb steel is independent of interpass interval times.
- Nb adding can delay the reverse transformation for as long as 200 s of holding. It is of important for hot rolling of heavy plates.
- The amount of retransformation thus depends on both the length of the interpass interval as well as the composition of the alloy.
