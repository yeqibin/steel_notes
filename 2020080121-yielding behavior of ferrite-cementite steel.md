### Character of the $\alpha / \theta$ interface and its effect on internal stress

The locally high internal stresses near the $\alpha / \theta$ interface caused by the misfit strains is related to the yield strength and yielding behavior.

The internal or residual stress can be classified into three types: macroscopic, phase or grain, and inside individual grain stress.

### Dislocation sources and grain-to-grain yielding behavior

Discontinuous yielding occurrence depends on two factors: an initially low dislocation density and a rapid dislocation multiplication.

The $\alpha / \theta$ interface may enhance the dislocation emission under an external stress and is thus considered as a potential nucleation site.

The critical stress for dislocation generation depends on the nucleation sources: 
grown-in dislocation = semi-coherent $\alpha / \theta$ interface < grain boundary = incoherent $\alpha / \theta$ interface < grain interior with no dislocation = theoretical strength.

## 结论

不同位错源对铁素体-渗碳体钢连续屈服和非连续屈服行为的影响。
1. $\alpha/\theta$ 界面半共格在应变时效前后都产生连续屈服，而非共格界面发生不连续屈服。
2. 相间热膨胀应变和共格错配是发生衍射峰宽化的两个因素。
3. 塑性变形启动发生在半共格更低外加载荷$\alpha/\theta$界面附近，而不是具有更高载荷的非共格界面和铁素体晶界。
4. $P_c$,位错形核所需临界剪切应力：grown-in dislocation = semi-coherent $\alpha / \theta$ interface < grain boundary = incoherent $\alpha / \theta$ interface < grain interior with no dislocation = theoretical strength.
5. 连续屈服和非连续屈服发生可以基于位错源的临界应力分布来解释。
