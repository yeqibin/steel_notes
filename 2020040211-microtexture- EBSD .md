The EBSD measurements were carried out at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and an emission current of about 100 $\mathrm{\mu}$ A at a specimen inclination angle of 70° towards the camera. Orientation maps were taken at a step size of 100 nm. In the present study, high-angle grain boundaries were defined as homophase interfaces with a misorientation angle of $\theta\ge 15^\circ$. Lower values of the local misorientation (2 $^\circ$< $\theta$< 15 °) low-angle grain boundaries. #microscopy
