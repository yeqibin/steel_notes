The internal friction (IF) behavior was investigated with **a dynamical mechanical analyzer (Perkin-Elmer DMA-8000)**. The DMA testing was measured in tension mode under a constant displacement amplitude of 5 µm (corresponding strain amplitude is 5 × 10$^{−4}$ ) and with a multi-frequency (4/10/20 Hz) mode at a cooling/heating rate of 4°C min$^{−1}$.
