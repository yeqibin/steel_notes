### The advantages of ultrafine grained steels:
 
 - great improvement in yield strength
   - TMCP使晶粒尺寸从10 µm降低到5 µm，提高屈服强度80 MPa
   - 如果5 µm降低到1 µm，则可以提高屈服强度350 MPa
   - further increase YS by 680 to over 1000 MPa even for a steel with lean composition
- excellent toughness: lower DBTT with lower upper shelf engergies 
- at minimal alloying
- improve weldability
- further potential domain: high strain rate superplasticity at medium and elevated temperatures. 

### related studies on mechanical properties of UFG steels

Two groups of methods to produce UFG steels
1. severe plastic deformation
    - discontinuous processes
    - require large true-strains over 4
3. advanced thermomechanical processes
    - phase transformation is essential
    - continuous processes

Among the second methods the phase transformation is essential.


**Weaknesses of previous studies about mechanical properties of UFG steels**

1. small work hardening at room temperature: necking occured already in the L$\ddot{\rm{u}}$ders regime, meaning small uniform elongation.
2. Charpy impact properties were rarely reported.


**The present study** 

1. 0.2%C-Mn steel: a very common steel
    - process: large strain warm deformation and annealing
    - baseline: a coarse grained steel with the same composition
2. Two goals
    - to know more about the insufficient work hardening, and introduce spheroidized cementite particles to improve the work hardening rate
    - to study the Charpy impact properties of the UFG steel
