## crystallography

angle-axis pairs
opposite shears
the misorientations between plates in individual pairs work out to be 180° for K-S, 180.06° for G-T and G-T', and 180.24° for N-W and P. These misorientations represent identical or near-identical orientations. This is why the plates in sets of accommodating pairs all appear to have the same orientation and why they are able to coalesce so readily during holding or continued deformation.

## Critical strain for DT

The critical strains to initiate DT can be accurately determined using the double differentiation or second derivative method from torsion or compression stress flow curves.\ref{Poliak, Jonas}.
- Polynomial fitting using MATLAB™ 
- plot strain hardening rate defined as $\theta=(\partial \sigma /\partial \varepsilon)_\varepsilon$ vs. stress ($\sigma$).
-  the choice of polynomial order has great effect on the results.

## Thermodynamic models for DT
1. stored energy
2. stress or mechanical activation
3. driving force associated with transformation softening
