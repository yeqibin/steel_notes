As we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:ufg-impact}, the impact energies of
longitudinal specimens are the highest, followed by \SI{45}{\degree}
specimens and transverse specimens. Above the temperatures of
\SI{-80}{\celsius}, the impact energies kept small changes, while a drastic drop
occurred when the testing performed below \SI{-100}{\celsius}, especially
for  and X2 steels. However, the energies were kept above \SI{50}{\joule}
for both steels. In comparison, UFG-WC steel has the best impact toughness
with higher than \SI{70}{\joule} even at the low temperatures
down to \SI{-150}{\celsius}, except for \SI{45}{\degree}
specimens. The impact testing shows that all the three steels exhibit
excellent toughness, but the energies are highly related to the orientations
of specimens, indicating there might exist strong texture in the steels.
