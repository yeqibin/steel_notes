## Highlights
- Loss of passivation (LOP) is identified for accelerated corrosion in a 13Cr martensite stainless steel
- The tempering temperature window for LOP effect of the studied MSS is 460-540 Â°C.
- The corrosion caused by Al-Mg-O rich inclusions and micro-sized M_23_C_6_ is differentiated.
- HRTEM shows the nano-sized M
