[[20200916-Nitrogen effects on radiation response in 12Cr ferrite-martensitic alloys]]

The yield strength was increased by irradiation, leading to the localized phase transformation at the onset of plastic deformation. Conversely, pre-straining was required to start transformation in the unirradiated material.

- Plastic instability 
- Increase martensitic start temperature *M~s*
- hardening mechanism
- deformation induced martensitic transformation
- deformation band
