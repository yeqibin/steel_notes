- Mn heterogeneity inducing highly dispersed $\mathrm{\gamma_{Mn-rich}}$ and $\mathrm{\gamma_{Mn-lean}}$ microzones, which was formed by well designed processing, can enhance the resistance to H embrittlement dramatically.

- The approach has a great potential for engineering application if a process can be developed for massive production, like hot-rolling.
-  How about applying this method on high-Ni steel?
