    - On the lower end of tempering temperatures typically employed by industry, often referred to as low temperature tempering (LTT), yield strengths well over 1 GPa, combined with tensile ductility exceeding 10 pct. culminating in ductile fracture, can be achieved.
    - For most practical applications, LTT is performed in the 150 째C to 200 째C range to maximize strength and ductility combinations, whereas tempering between 200 째C and 400 째C may lead to significant embrittlement.
