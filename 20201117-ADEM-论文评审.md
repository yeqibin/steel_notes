2. The strength determined by HV hardness measurement is likely improperly
3. The directions of EBSD sample should be noted in respect of the RD/TD

The manuscript investigates the texture formation of 12Cr-2W steel with F/M phases 

- UFG steel 
手稿中那么多的极图、EBSD和TEM图片，只得到这么一个结论貌似不合适，结论中也存在这个问题，而且摘要和结论基本是一样的内容

前言部分写的还是比较乱的，啥内容都往上写了，但是没抓住重点，而且病句较多，感觉就是咱们这边的初稿水平,全文没有两端对齐，首段前面没有空一格，导致部分段落混乱，分不清新段落的开始

首次出现没有全称

1.  Page 1 line 56: "UFG" should be "ultra fined grained (UFG)".  Define all acronyms the first time you use the full word or phrase.


2. Page 2 line 5-12: sentences of "It is known..." and "Depending on..." present the same meaning, delete one.
3.  Page 2 line 19-29: "In particular, at rolling of austenitic steel:.... Orientations in ferritic steel." confuses orientations in ferritic steel  while the sentence is describing the rolling austenitic steel. 
4. Page 3 line 57:"$\mathrm{0.25~mm\times s^{-1}}$" should be "$\mathrm{0.25~mm~s^{-1}}$"
5. Page 5 line 49: "...which is rather high (Figure 2, top row)". However, what we can see in Figure 2, the texture intensity of the tempered sample is rather low according to the intensity scale, which should also be clearer to show.
6. Page 5 line 61 : "...is somewhat different than that characteristic of..." should be "...is somewhat different than the characteristic of..."
7. Page 6 line2 and 5, the citation of [5] should be placed at the proper positions, like the end of the sentences.
8. Page 7 Table 2: the changes of the fraction are not clear using table. It will be more intuitive using plots such as bar chart.
9. Page 7 line 39-44: "Table 2 summarizes...of ECAPed steel. A comparative analysis of Table 2..."the two sentences are wordy, combining them into one instead should be more clean. 
10. Page 7 line 51, "...higher than for the ECAP sample." should be "...higher than that of the ECAP sample."
11. Page 12 line 22: "...oirigin of such..." should be misspelled of "...origin of such..."
12. Page 13 line 35-43: the sentence should be separated into two sentences at the semi-colon position.
13. Page 13 line 45: "...in." is unneeded.
14. Page 13 last paragraph: the author should give the evidence that can determine the type of the carbide as M23C6, such as diffraction pattern.
15. Page 14 Figure 10: the "(c,d)" is likely missing ahead of "after ECAP+R95+RQ;"
16. Page 14 Figure 10: the evidence (the arrows  point in the dark field TEM images) that the authors claim for microtwins is not likely to be true, instead they are more likely to be carbides since they appear the same lightness as the other globular carbides do. 
17. Page 15 Figure 11 and the corresponding description in the first paragraph of page 11: it is odd to use "MPa" instead of "HV" from microhardness testing, and the values over 3000 MPa are too too high for this F/M steel. The values and how to get "MPa" from the micro hardness measurement should be clearly described. 
18. Since the evidence of twinning is weak, there is no ground for the conclusion about the activation of twinning.
