complex texture development from recrystallization austenite，deformed austenite，transformation texture， recrystallization ferritic texture.

Textures are presented in the form of an orientation distribution function (ODF).

- $\alpha$. —fiber collects orientations with the $\langle110\rangle  \| \text{RD}$
- $\gamma$ —fiber is the collection of orientations with the $\{111\}$ plane parallel to the rolling plane. 

## Notes on \cite{song2005am}

### Importance of UFG for steels

- improve both strength and toughness simultaneously
- avoid adding alloying elements
- improve weldability 
- high strain rate superplasticity at medium and elevated temperatures

The term of ultrafine grain:
- $1-2$  &#xB5;m diameter; 
- submicron structure $100-1000~\text{nm}$
- nano-structure <100 nm

### Scope 

The evolution of microstructure and crystallographic texture during large strain warm deformation and subsequent annealing.

Purpose: to develop well tailored and microstructrually guided approaches to the large scale production of ultrafine grained steels.

## crystallographic texture during warm deformation

The texture is dominated by a pronounced $\alpha-(\langle 110\rangle \|\text{RD})$
