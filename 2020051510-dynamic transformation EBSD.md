### EBSD techniques to characterize DT

### Fe-0.06 wt%-0.01 wt%Si-0.3 wt%Mn-0.042 wt%Al

1. IPF and IQ map of the ferrite phase (radial/circumferential direction)
2. IPF of the martensite phase (very small dots)
3. grain/plate boundary misorientation map
4. misorientation profile measured along the white lin
    5. $1.5\leq\theta<3$
    6. $3\leq\theta<5$
    7. $5\leq\theta<10$
    8. $10\leq\theta<55$
    9. $55\leq\theta\leq60$
    
The presence of the dynamically formed Widmanstätten ferrite plates can clearly be observed in high EBSD images. 

- The DT Widmanstätten ferrite plates are a few hundred nanometers wide.
- During formation, carbon is rejected into the adjacent austenite. 
- The carbon enriched austenite in turn transforms into martensite on quenching, which is located at a grain boundary and at plate boundaries.
- very small value of the misorientation between the ferrite plates,which enable coalesce so readily into grains at larger strains.
