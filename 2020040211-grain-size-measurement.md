Compared with low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle grain boundaries are more important for strengthening. Also, high-angle grain boundaries are more efficient in improving the toughness of steels. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly identify and quantitatively charac- terize the grain boundary character together with the analysis of the grain size [28]. Also, careful characterization of the average grain size is essential for predicting the mechanical properties of steels in terms of the Hall–Petch relationship. For this reason, in this study the ferrite grain size (counting only grains with a grain boundary misorientation h P 15°) produced by the ultrafine grain route was measured by use of EBSD maps in conjunction with the mean linear intercept method. The spacing between the grain boundaries was measured both, along the normal direction (ND) and the rolling direction (RD). The grain size is then defined as the average diameter of **the equivalent area circles ** which match the area of the elliptically shaped grains. The ferrite grain size produced by the conventional route was measured by use of the mean linear intercept method.
