Microstructural characterization methods.
- OM, SEM, EBSD, TEM, APT

The diffusion distances the interstitial and substitutional atoms.

- carbon takes about 100 µs to transverse a distance of about 100 nm in ferrite at about 743 °C.
- Mn can only cover a distance of 0.12 nm at the same temperature.
- \ref{90}
- As there is insufficient time for substitutional diffusion, although nucleation is displacive, growth occurs under paraequilibrium conditions.

### Optical results

the martensite produced by quenching the deformed austenite from the experimental temperatures. This is depicted in Fig.24(a) and (b)
- DT ferrite formed in much of the microstructure
- The martensite formed in the regions where the strain remained below the critical value for the formation of DT ferrite.

There are two Ae$_3$ temperatures
- orthoequilibrium
- paraequilibrium 

the volume fraction of the DT ferrite increased with strain at a rate that was largely independent of strain rate. Martensite needles were observed to form during quenching.
- DT ferrite is Widmanstätten in nature.

#### Fe-6 wt%Ni-0.1 wt% C steel

- compression at a strain rate of 10$^{-1}$ s$^{-1} to strain levels of 
    - $\varepsilon=0.33$, 15% DT ferrite
    - $\varepsilon=0.96%$, 55% DT ferrite 

### SEM results 

The freshly formed ferrite is predominantly plate-like in morphology.
- some of which contain cementite particles that are detectable only at higher magnification.
- The straight interfaces
- When the strain was increased, the initial plate-like structure was gradually converted into fairly equiaxed grains.
- a complex mixture of both grains and plates of ferrite located in a martensite matrix.
- Cementite particles 
- The existence of martensite (prior austenite) after such large strains indicates that some areas of the material had not yet reached the critical strain for dynamic transformation (DT) and the the resolve shear stress (driving force for DT) had not attained a high enough level in these particular regions of the specimens to provoke the transformation.

comment: the higher hardenability, the larger critical strain needed for dynamic transformation (DT).
						  
- [ ] check the hardenability of Fe-	0.06 wt%C-1.9/3.0 wt% Mn steel for crack arrest steel

### EBSD 


### TEM results

The concurrent presence of ferrite, cementite and martensite in DT microstructures has been verified using TEM techniques.
