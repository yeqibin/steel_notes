### APT results
- carbon in martensite is less than nominal composition due to formation of cementite, which reduces the carbon concentration in the residual austenite.
- the concentration of Mn and Si is identical in martensite and plate ferrite. This is supportive for paraequilibrium transformation without partitioning of substitutional solutes during DT.
- carbon enrichment occurs at dislocations and shear bands (as high as 0.9-2 wt%) 

#### Effect of strain, strain rate and chemical composition on phase proportions

- there is a critical strain for DT (0.3-1.1)
    - 应该做这方面的实验，测出每个温度下的 critical strain
- strain rate has little effect on DT rate
  - 没必要考虑这个变量

#### Effect of temperature on phase proportions and microhardness values
@chang2002
- The amounts of DT ferrite and cementite can be evaluated by quenched martensite, which represents the untransformed austenite.

#### Plate coalescence

- The misorientations between the Widmanstätten ferrite plates formed by DT are very small.
- That is readily to coalescence into grains with continued straining, which can be identified by gradually being dissolved plate boundary.
- DT microstructure composes of a mixture of both plates (Widmanstätten ferrite) and grains (from coalescence of plates). The ratio of DT ferrite plates to grains decreases with strain.The coalescence of plates occurs with continued straining.
- The higher carbon content (austenite and cementite at boundaries) and Nb (solute drag) retard the coalescence of DT plates into grains.

### Likely DT mechanisms


- Relate the resulted microstructural scales to the diffusion distance at the transformation time scales

$$\bar{X}=\sqrt{(Dt)}$$

$$D=D_0 \exp(-Q/RT)$$

**Conclusion**

- carbon can diffuse
- Mn can't diffuse
