Fig 6 indicates that the overall intensities of the C textures are low for XXX
The sharpness increases significantly after ferrite rolling at 630. In all cases, the major texture component is the {001}<110>. In the sample, there is also a strong component at {110}<110>. The intensity of the latter decreases as the finish rolling temperature si lowered and it disappears completely after ferrite rolling. 
A component near {865}<4310> (which is close to {332}<113>) appears in the texture of the sample....and its intensity increases when the finishing temperature is lowered to 730 Â°C. Finally after ferrite rolling, the {332}<113> is displaced to become a strong {554}<225> component. The {223}<110> orientation appears as an important texture component.

Textures are much sharper than those of
